                <p class="pb-0">Some time ago I was brought out to the Getty Villa in L.A. to check out the statue you see on your right. At the time, he was introduced to me as Andy, and the name stuck. At the time, Andy’s provenance was completely unknown to me, but the focal point of the entire trip would be to determine his provenance. Just on a surface level, he’s a baby staring down at the floor with an almost somber look, but not exactly somber. During my visit to Rome, it reminded me of this one statue in particular that I saw at the Centrale Montemartini (a museum catalog I wrote about it is visible <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12xMuJ3IRlkQ4o6cTcaGp7-pOjXG-ettCnYUAHmZp2DM/edit?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration:underline;">here</a>). She was looking at the ground with a very similar expression and pose, resting on one arm looking at the ground with a face currently in thought; anxious, but not under immediate pressure. Furthermore, he rests on a block with some kind of tower and butterfly-esque engraving.</p>

                  The Origins of our Statue

              In my first few days in Rome, I met another grad student. Ultimately, she proved to be an impediment in our research, but she did contribute some key information for our analysis of Andy’s home. Her dissertation was on funerary work and their depiction of families and children, and she showed me the funerary tablet above. It is the Haterii Relief from ~100 CE. If we compare Andy to the many babies on this tablet, especially those at the bottom, we can create a link to the possible function of Andy. There are babies littered throughout the funerary tablet, but most notably there is a baby towards the center of the bottom holding a remarkably similar pose; they both have that same particular “thinking” look and resting pose. The similarity of the engraving to the full 3D statue builds a strong case that Andy’s function was as a supplement to religious or funerary sites.

              We know what we’re looking for now: burial sites and tombs. That admittedly leaves lots of places. We can narrow it down by noting that any place with many bones or corpses must be near a very wealthy or highly religious location; if it is just a common burial site, it is much less likely they’d spend their resources on statues. So we know now to focus on these kinds of wealthy and/or religious spots, and lucky for us the crux of my visit to Rome was to dig at exactly one of these kinds of sites: The Casavenere.

              In my dig at the Casavenere, we found the same animal bone found in the frame of the previous section. Rosario was one of the many aids on my excavation of the Casavanere, and helps to fill in a lot of the blanks. We know from him that the Casavanere at least in part held tombs of various types, and the existence of the animal bone we found indicates that this was also a religious site. The mosaic above even further indicates that there would be a lot of resources dedicated to this site, and we know it had some kind of religious and funerary purpose. This fills all the previously mentioned qualifications to a tee. The nail in the coffin came from Dr. Forza our superintendent, who supplied us with old excavation journals relating to the site. We finally landed on a statue denoted as “The Statue of the Boy Who Sleep” that looked INCREDIBLY similar to ours. Even if you don’t believe that this is our statue exactly, this all compounds to pin the origin of Andy to the Casavenere.

                  Now What?
                </h3>
                <p style="text-align:center;">After having analyzed Andy as much as we possibly can, we’re left with the question of where to put him. He came from a private collection and holds no provenance, so we can thus presume that he might have been unlawfully excavated and extracted to the Getty Villa. It was received in 1973 after the UNESCO convention, but if the journals are to be believed our statue very well could have been excavated after 1970 and could simply be unlawful to hold. If it was taken before, however, we’re left with a hard call. Do we keep him in America to expose people who have never been exposed to such a culture before, or put him where he came from in Rome? Personally, I believe we should leave it with the Getty Villa. As much as I’ve come to know and adore Andy, I don’t believe that he is a statue of incredible significance (compared to others, of course- all statues are incredible pieces of history). Recall back to the funerary tablet- it’s very likely far more were made and can be placed in Rome. Both the relative lack of importance and uniqueness leaves no real important reason to bring Andy back to Rome other than being his “home”. I had no clue babies were so important in Roman funerary processions and I bet hardly anyone going into the Getty Villa knows either. If we keep Andy at the Getty Villa, we can expose more people to this ancient culture that they wouldn’t otherwise know about. They might be intrigued as to why babies are so important in practices related to death, and want to seek more, whereas such a thing wouldn’t happen in Rome, and it would go far more unappreciated as more people would know about the relation between babies and ancient funerary practices.</p>
                <p style="text-align:center;"> Let’s keep Andy at the Getty Villa. </p>
